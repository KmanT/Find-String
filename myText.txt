I have taken a web design class in high school, but I haven't made a website since. However, I've been learning programming languages such as Java, C++, and Visual Basic. I enjoy doing both and its great getting back into web design which has been enjoyable and refreshing so far.

Back in Farmington Hills, where I came from, I used to do freelance personal training focused on strength, which has helped several people improved themselves. My main work though was working for the Law Offices of Willaim J. McHenry doing file management, providing research for various products for cases, and other IT work there.
